# docker-ds

Lightweight image for running data science projects. Based, in some part, off of the [cookiecutter-docker-science repo](https://github.com/docker-science/cookiecutter-docker-science).

1. Create a project / team image with a base development environment (which packages, etc.)
2. Mount volume containing notebooks and data

**Goal**

1. Improve reproducibility by creating base image
2. Create optimal file and directory template
3. Allow for editing (by mounting)
